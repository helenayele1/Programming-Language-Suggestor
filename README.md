## Description

This web application helps users determine a coding language that suits them based on their preferences. Users answer a series of questions related to their level of expertise, hobbies, and preferences. The application then analyzes the responses and suggests a coding language that aligns with their answers. If no suitable suggestion is available, the application prompts users to learn more about different coding languages.
